## Meeting 3/29/2022:
- Goals: Revise proposal
- We will need to delimit all sentences before entering them into the graph
- We will use an adjacency list to generate the graph between all words, this list will represent a directed graph
- Added date deadlines for major milestones in our project timeline.

## Meeting 4/5/2022
- What we got done: making the graph class and creating a function to parse the strings into indicidual words.
- Goals: import shaksperian data and begin implementation with graph class
- Fixed the insert and getPrev function
- We need to write test cases 
- Goals for this week: add BFS and DFS to graph class, one person each. Should be own files. Import the data. 
- Sofia: BFS. Jake: DFS. Mohammad: import the data and get it into a graph. David: start shortest path

## Meeting 4/10/2022
- What we got done: Finished both traversals and got a working, but inefficient vector adjacency list
- Goals: Improve big(O) running time of adjacency list and begin working on shortest path
- Began working on implementing the catch testing framework

## Meeting 4/20/2022 (Midpoint presentation)
- Need to update shortest path to include trace of nodes visited
- Need to include edge cost to implement Djikstras

## Meeting 4/26/2022
- What we got done: Vastly improved the big O running time of accessing elements from the adjacency list, finished djikstra's algorithm with appropriate weighted edges, and began writing test cases for both depth and breadth searches
- Goals: Finish writing test cases, begin strongly connected compnents, and begin final project deliverables
- Sofia: Deliverables. Jake: Deliverables. Mohammad: Strongly Connected components. David: Strongly Connected component

## Meeting 5/4/2022
- We are currently stuck with many segfaults in test cases but not in main for some reason
- Note: Segfaults resolved by changing structure of adjacency list. :)
