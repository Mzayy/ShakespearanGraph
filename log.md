# Weekly Progress
## 4/3/2022:
- Goals for This Week:
  1. A set up graph class
  2. Parse data
- Specific Tasks:
  1. Implement basic main that splits sentences into words and filters out any symbols
  2. Create wordgraph.cpp and wordgraph.h
- Problems:
  1. None yet
- Goals for Next Week
  1. Import Shakespearan data
  2. Begin implementation with graph class
## 4/10/2022:
- Goals for This Week:
  1. Create BFS Traversal
  2. Create DFS Traversal
  3. Import Shakespearan data and add to graph implementation
  4. Begin shortest path algorithm
- Specific Tasks:
  1. Create BFS .cpp/.h (Sofia)
  2. Create DFS .cpp/.h (Jake)
  3. Import Shakespeare_data.csv and add words as nodes (Mohammad)
