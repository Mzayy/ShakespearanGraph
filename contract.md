# Team Contract

## Communication
1. Team Meetings 
Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 4-5 PM using Discord. We will meet additional days if necessary. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.

2. Communication
Our primary form of communication will be Discord. We can all quickly respond to questions, host meetings, and share files and links there. Our secondary form will be email, and commit to responding to emails in under 48 hours. 

3. Respect 
The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. They should make sure that every group members ideas are taken into account. Decisions will be discussed as a group. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration
1. Work Distribution 
Each week, the work that needs to be done will be discussed during meetings and split up amongst group members. Group members can volunteer to work on different parts of the project. If there is an unbalanced workload, adjustments can be made for the current week or for future weeks. 

2. Time Commitment 
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If someone's part is taking a very long time, the remaining work can be split up amongst the other group members to help. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

3. If a team member is repeatedly not completing their work, they will be asked to explain why and the issue may be taken to a staff member if needed. This would probably first be the project mentor and if it is still a large problem, the problem may be taken to a higher staff member. 

4. Conflict Resolution 
All conflicts within the team will be discussed with the whole group. If a problem persists, a staff member can be contacted to help resolve the issue.
