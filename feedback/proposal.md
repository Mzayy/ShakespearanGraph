### Comments

Great introduction to the **leading question** and motivation. However, I am unsure how the selected algorithms (some traversal?, shortest path, and strongly connected component)  will provide insight into the target works.

The **dataset** section shows a deeper understanding of the dataset. I appreciate the list of invalid values as well as your consideration into punctuations and rare words. One suggestion would be to elaborate the "text graph" a bit more. What is it? How would you turn text document(s) into a text graph?

The **algorithm** section unfortunately misses many details, e.g. names of the selected algorithms (or equivalently how they work), input/output, and time/space complexity.
- If the graph is undirected, then union-find (based on disjoint-set data structure) should suffice without a generic strongly connected component algorithm.
- Potential features are very interesting but could require more efforts to complete. Which models and inference algorithms are you considering?

The **timeline** lays out some steps to complete the project but lacking potential soft/hard deadlines. Please take some time to estimate the dates.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further question or need clarification. Keep up the great work!
